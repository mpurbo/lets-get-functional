## Functor

_Wrapper_ is a concept frequently used in object-oriented programming. We use wrappers for many reasons. Sometimes we use it to hide some specific implementations so that we can just interface with a simpler, more abstract form of the structure. Sometimes we simply want to extend the wrapped object with some operations, especially when the class of the wrapped object is `final` (cannot be extended).

Another concept that is related is _Container_.
